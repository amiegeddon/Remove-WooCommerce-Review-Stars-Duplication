# Remove WooCommerce Review Stars Duplication

I took from the original code provided by WooThemes and adjusted it to meet my site's needs. 
The original code can be found here: https://support.woothemes.com/hc/en-us/articles/203103677-Replace-theme-ratings-with-WooCommerce-stars

You can find the star image at the link provided or get it from "plugins/WooCommerce/assets/images" and place it in your themes "images" folder.

This code is available for anyone still having duplication issues with WooCommerce stars after trying the code provided by WooThemes.

This code should be added to your custom.css or, if you have a child theme, the style.css.
